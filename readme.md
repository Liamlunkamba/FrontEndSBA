Ayo Steven was up, as you will be going through the project, you will see that I have done such an amazing job 
-  I used bootstrap utility classes to handle as much styling as possible
-Include valid and appropriate HTML throughout the implementation.
- I used valid CSS to handle anything that you cannot handle with Bootstrap.
